# 🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on user-provided medical parameters.
The application is built using Streamlit for an interactive UI and scikit-learn for ML model inference.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of diseases can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
This project uses pre-trained machine learning models to assist in predicting multiple diseases through a single, user-friendly web interface.

Supported Predictions

🩸 Diabetes

❤️ Heart Disease

🧠 Parkinson’s Disease

## 🚀 Key Features

Single platform for multiple disease predictions

Clean and interactive Streamlit UI

Pre-trained Machine Learning models

Real-time prediction results

Input validation using numeric controls

Easy to deploy on Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Disease	Algorithm Used

Diabetes	Logistic Regression / SVM

Heart Disease	Logistic Regression

Parkinson’s	Support Vector Machine (SVM)

(Models trained using publicly available medical datasets)
